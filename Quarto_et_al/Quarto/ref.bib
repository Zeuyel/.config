  abstract = {Developing an effective interval-valued time series (ITS) forecasting scheme for electric power generation is an important issue for energy operators and governments when making energy strategic decisions. The existing studies for ITS forecasting only consider basic descriptive information such as center, radius, upper and lower bounds, and overlooks the distribution information within the data interval. In this study, an interval-valued time series forecasting scheme based on probability distribution information features of interval-valued data with machine learning algorithms is proposed to enhance electric power generation forecasting. In the proposed scheme, the central tendency features and dispersion features from the interval-valued data are designed as integrated features sets (IFS) and used as predictor variables. Three methods including supper vector regression and extreme learning machine and multivariate adaptive regression splines based on the IFS are utilized to develop ITS forecasting models. The daily time series of the metered generation from the Australian Energy Market Operator is used to illustrate the proposed scheme. Empirical results show that the proposed ITS forecasting schemes with IFS outperform the eight benchmark models and thus validate that the proposed scheme is an effective alternative for interval-valued electric power generation forecasting.},

  abstract = {Time series forecasting is a critical and challenging problem in many real applications. Recently, Transformer-based models prevail in time series forecasting due to their advancement in long-range dependencies learning. Besides, some models introduce series decomposition to further unveil reliable yet plain temporal dependencies. Unfortunately, few models could handle complicated periodical patterns, such as multiple periods, variable periods, and phase shifts in real-world datasets. Meanwhile, the notorious quadratic complexity of dot-product attentions hampers long sequence modeling. To address these challenges, we design an innovative framework Quaternion Transformer (Quatformer), along with three major components: 1). learning-to-rotate attention (LRA) based on quaternions which introduces learnable period and phase information to depict intricate periodical patterns. 2). trend normalization to normalize the series representations in hidden layers of the model considering the slowly varying characteristic of trend. 3). decoupling LRA using global memory to achieve linear complexity without losing prediction accuracy. We evaluate our framework on multiple real-world time series datasets and observe an average 8.1\% and up to 18.5\% MSE improvement over the best state-of-the-art baseline.},

  abstract = {In order to improve the flood forecasting accuracy and reflect the forecast uncertainty information in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) interval-basin in China, this study integrates the feature and temporal dual-attention (DA) mechanism and recursive encoder-decoder (RED) structure into the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to develop a DA-LSTM-RED model. The feature attention acts on the input variables of the encoder, and the temporal attention mechanism acts on the hidden layer states extracted by the LSTM neural network during encoding process, prompting the proposed model to extract critical input information among different types and moments of input variables to improve the multi-step-ahead flood forecasting accuracy. Second, the copula-based Hydrological Uncertainty Processor (copula-HUP) is used to quantify the forecast uncertainty of the proposed model meanwhile creating multi-step-ahead flood probabilistic forecasts. Combining the long-term 6 h hydrologic data series of the Xiangjiaba-TGR interval-basin and the forecasted precipitation from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the effectiveness of the proposed model, the effect of forecast precipitation on multi-step-ahead flood forecasting, and the effect of different copula functions on the probabilistic forecast of copula-HUP are investigated, respectively. The results show that the DALSTM-RED model can effectively improve the forecasting accuracy for long forecast horizons (3-7d) compared to the LSTM-RED model, and the average absolute error metrics are reduced by 10\%-17\%. Meanwhile, the proposed model can identify input variables with a high correlation with the target output variables, which improves the interpretability of deep learning to a certain extent. The Student copula-HUP has the lowest RB and CRPS metrics than the Frank and Gaussian copula-HUP, which can better quantify the DA-LSTM-RED model's forecast un\- certainty. Therefore, combining the proposed model with the Student copula-HUP can effectively reduce the forecasting uncertainty, enhance the forecasting reliability and accuracy for future horizons, and provide reliable risk information for the TGR flood control scheduling decision.},

Numerous predictive models based on statistical and intelligent methods have been proposed but using a single model or method cannot afford noise reduction so as to achieve credible results in facilitating regulation and investment. This study presents a novel hybrid model of multi-channel VMD-CBAM-BiLSTM named McVCsB based on an improved decomposition-reconstruction predicting framework for stock index prediction. The variational modal decomposition algorithm (VMD) and convolutional block attention module (CBAM) are adopted to achieve noise filtration and deep-level feature extraction. The denoised and concentrated feature will feed the predicting mechanism of bi-directional longshort-term networks (BiLSTM) to produce a stock index for the next day. The multi-channel input structure is innovated to resolve the inherent cumulative error problem of the decomposition-reconstruction framework by changing the parallel processing manner. We design three levels of model comparison by selecting and constructing a variety of benchmark models. In both statistical and practical assessments, the proposed model outperforms others with high reliability and robustness. According to the empirical results on four stock composite indexes, the McVCsB gives the best performance on China's SCI out-of-sample prediction with the mean absolute error of 0.0016, root mean square error of 0.0019, symmetric mean absolute percentage error of 0.3862, R2 of 0.9989 and Sharpe ratio of 0.6648. Thus, this new proposed model provides an effective predicting tool and can be extensively applied to stock markets in a more widen range.},

We name this framework SCNN, short for Structured Component-based Neural Network. SCNN works with a pre-defined generative process of MTS, which arithmetically characterizes the latent structure of the spatial-temporal patterns. In line with its reverse process, SCNN decouples MTS data into structured and heterogeneous components and then respectively extrapolates the evolution of these components, the dynamics of which is more traceable and predictable than the original MTS. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that SCNN can achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art models on three real-world datasets.

Therefore, accurate predictions of EVs sales and stock are crucial to deploying charging infrastructures, improving industrial policies, and providing credible references of the renewable sources demand in the transportation system. To this end, a new self-adaptive optimized grey model is proposed with the following improvements: first, a dynamic weighted sequence is generated to extract more value from the available observations by sufficiently highlighting the new data without information lapses. Second, the weighted coefficient and modified initial condition can adjust to various samples and thus augment the applicability of the proposed model. Third, Simpson's formula is utilized to reconstruct the background value and then integrated with the modified initial condition to smooth the data saltations and further enhance the forecasting precision. To validate the rationality and efficacy of the novel model, four cases regarding the sales and stock of EVs are simulated by the proposed model compared with six benchmarks. As demonstrated in the empirical results, the novel model performs with the highest forecasting precision in most cases, which reveals that the optimization techniques exerted on the initial condition and background value can strikingly enhance the adaptability and prediction accuracy of the grey model. Thus, the novel model can be regarded as a promising tool for EVs prediction.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Accordingly, a multivariable grey convolution model (GMC (1, \emph{n})) having correct solutions is put forward to deal with such complicated and uncertain issues, instead of the incorrect multivariable grey model (GM (1, \emph{n})). However, the conventional approach to computing background values of the GMC (1, \emph{n}) model is inaccurate, and this model's forecasting accuracy cannot be expected. Thereby, the drawback analysis of the GMC (1, \emph{n}) model is conducted with mathematical reasoning, which can explain why this model is inaccurate in some applications. In order to eliminate the drawbacks, a new optimized GMC (1, \emph{n}), shorted for OGMC (1, \emph{n}), is proposed, whose background values are calculated based on Simpson' rule that is able to efficiently approximate the integration of a function. Furthermore, its extended version that uses the Gaussian rule to discretize the convolution integral, abbreviated as OGMC\textsubscript{G} (1, \emph{n}), is proposed to further enhance the model's forecasting ability. In general, these two optimized models have such advantages as simplified structure, consistent forecasting performance, and satisfactory efficiency. Three empirical studies are carried out for verifying the above advantages of the optimized model, compared with the conventional GMC (1, \emph{n}), GMC\textsubscript{G} (1, \emph{n}), GM (1, \emph{n}), and DGM (1, \emph{n}) models.

However, their memory and compute-intensive requirements pose a critical bottleneck for long-term forecasting, despite numerous advancements in compute-aware self-attention modules. To address this, we propose TSMixer, a lightweight neural architecture exclusively composed of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modules. TSMixer is designed for multivariate forecasting and representation learning on patched time series, providing an efficient alternative to Transformers. Our model draws inspiration from the success of MLP-Mixer models in computer vision. We demonstrate the challenges involved in adapting Vision MLP-Mixer for time series and introduce empirically validated components to enhance accuracy. This includes a novel design paradigm of attaching online reconciliation heads to the MLPMixer backbone, for explicitly modeling the time-series properties such as hierarchy and channel-correlations. We also propose a Hybrid channel modeling approach to effectively handle noisy channel interactions and generalization across diverse datasets, a common challenge in existing patch channel-mixing methods. Additionally, a simple gated attention mechanism is introduced in the backbone to prioritize important features. By incorporating these lightweight components, we significantly enhance the learning capability of simple MLP structures, outperforming complex Transformer models with minimal computing usage. Moreover, TSMixer's modular design enables compatibility with both supervised and masked self-supervised learning methods, making it a promising building block for time-series Foundation Models. TSMixer outperforms state-of-the-art MLP and Transformer models in forecasting by a considerable margin of 8-60\%. It also outperforms the latest strong benchmarks of Patch-Transformer models (by 1-2\%) with a significant reduction in memory and runtime (2-3X).},

  abstract = {Time series often reflect variation associated with other related variables. Controlling for the effect of these variables is useful when modeling or analysing the time series. We introduce a novel approach to normalize time series data conditional on a set of covariates. We do this by modeling the conditional mean and the conditional variance of the time series with generalized additive models using a set of covariates. The conditional mean and variance are then used to normalize the time series. We illustrate the use of conditionally normalized series using two applications involving river network data. First, we show how these normalized time series can be used to impute missing values in the data. Second, we show how the normalized series can be used to estimate the conditional autocorrelation function and conditional cross-correlation functions via additive models. Finally we use the conditional cross-correlations to estimate the time it takes water to flow between two locations in a river network.},

  abstract = {The basic and most commonly used application of modern multibeam echosounders (MBES) is the bathymetric survey. Surface sound velocity errors introduce errors on beam steering angles and consequently errors in depth and position values. Due to systematic malfunction and troubleshooting of the sound velocity sensor (SVS) on board Polish Navy hydrographic ship Arctowski, attempts to solve the problem were made. All the inspections and cleaning of the sensor were performed with the use of divers or while staying in the shipyard. Diving work did not always bring the expected results and periodic ship docking was quite expensive. The article shows the importance of the SVS sensor in bathymetric measurements using multibeam echosounder. Selected problems of the sensor operation and temporary solutions were presented. The paper provides a description of practical solutions implemented aboard the navy ship Arctowski. The idea and implementation were the result of the author's experience gained during 18 years of service on board that ship.},

  abstract = {Financial time series prediction has many applications in economics, but producing profitable strategies certainly has a special place among them, a daunting challenge. Statistical and machine learning techniques are intensively researched in the search for a holy grail of stock markets forecasting. However, it is not clear to prospecting researchers how good those popular models are regarding useful predictions on a real scenario. This paper contributes to that discussion, providing decisive evidences contrary to the use of basic out-of-the-box models, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Naive-Bayes (NB). Results consider optimistic and unreal variables often found in literature, as well as a more close-to-real simulation of the models usage. Specifically, current day closing prices direction forecasting results are contrasted with those on next day forecasts. As expected, when forecasting the current day, accuracy is almost perfect. However, when used to forecast next day closing direction, with a strict data separation policy and without direction or snooping bias, ANN, SVM, RF and NB produce results essentially equal to random guessing. The main achieved result is the demonstration of how a machine learning approach would fare in a support decision system for forecasting short-term future market direction, regardless of the level of market development, considering more than 100 securities in a 10 years period. Consequences for algorithmic trading relate to discouraging usage of the considered models as implemented here. On a more abstract sense, this paper presents more evidence to the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH).},

The aim of this paper is to develop a hybrid interval-valued time series prediction model, namely, BEMDCR-SE-PSO-SVM, by considering daily changes in pollutant concentrations and thereby realize interval-valued PM2.5 concentration prediction with high accuracy. The theoretical contributions in this paper include (1) the problem of edge effects corresponding to BEMD associated with interval-valued time-series is addressed by using the mirror extension method, and (2) the transformation between interval-valued time series and complex-valued signals is renewed from the perspective of centre/radius so that lower data fluctuations can be obtained. Technologically, sample entropy is introduced to provide an objective way to integrate decomposed similar IMFs so that subsequent prediction processes can be simplified. Finally, a numerical example is shown to illustrate the feasibility and validity of the developed hybrid interval-valued time series prediction model.},

However, in the original form of this model, the time-power parameter {$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\alpha<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$} normally equals to an integer, and then the analytical expression of the time response function will be obtained. Otherwise, if the parameter {$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\alpha<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$} equals to a non-integer, one cannot obtain the concrete time response function for future estimations. This situation may significantly restrict the applications of this grey model. To address such drawbacks, an optimized version is designed in this work. In the proposed model, a simplified solution to the differential equation is derived by using the definite integral technique. Furthermore, for improving accuracy, the time-power parameter {$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\alpha<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$} is optimized by utilizing the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm based on the model parameter packages. Subsequently, the efficacy and practicality of this simplified function have been verified by numerical simulations and experimental studies. Moreover, the method of probability density prediction is employed for verifying the reliability and stability of the proposed model for the first time when predicting the settlement of the soft-clay subgrade on an expressway. The demonstration cases illustrate that the quantitative improvements over forecasts of the proposed model are even more pronounced with a level accuracy of 2.29\% and 1.19\% MAPE values in the fitted and predicted periods, respectively, which can significantly increase the predicting accuracy by more than 10\% with respect to the other benchmarks.

  abstract = {Time series forecasting is an important problem across many domains, including predictions of solar plant energy output, electricity consumption, and traffic jam situation. In this paper, we propose to tackle such forecasting problem with Transformer [1]. Although impressed by its performance in our preliminary study, we found its two major weaknesses: (1) locality-agnostics: the point-wise dotproduct self-attention in canonical Transformer architecture is insensitive to local context, which can make the model prone to anomalies in time series; (2) memory bottleneck: space complexity of canonical Transformer grows quadratically with sequence length L, making directly modeling long time series infeasible. In order to solve these two issues, we first propose convolutional self-attention by producing queries and keys with causal convolution so that local context can be better incorporated into attention mechanism. Then, we propose LogSparse Transformer with only O(L(log L)2) memory cost, improving forecasting accuracy for time series with fine granularity and strong long-term dependencies under constrained memory budget. Our experiments on both synthetic data and realworld datasets show that it compares favorably to the state-of-the-art.},

Text data such as financial news and social media posts can be part of the reasons for stock price movement. To this end, we propose a novel framework of Prediction-Explanation Network (PEN) jointly modeling text streams and price streams with alignment. The key component of the PEN model is an shared representation learning module that learns which texts are possibly associated with the stock price movement by modeling the interaction between the text data and stock price data with a salient vector characterizing their correlation. In this way, the PEN model is able to predict the stock price movement by identifying and utilizing abundant messages while on the other hand, the selected text messages also explain the stock price movement. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that we are able to kill two birds with one stone: in terms of accuracy, the proposed PEN model outperforms the state-of-art baseline; on explainability, the PEN model are demonstrated to be far superior to attention mechanism, capable of picking out the crucial texts with a very high confidence.},

  abstract = {The recent boom of linear forecasting models questions the ongoing passion for architectural modifications of Transformer-based forecasters. These forecasters leverage Transformers to model the global dependencies over temporal tokens of time series, with each token formed by multiple variates of the same timestamp. However, Transformer is challenged in forecasting series with larger lookback windows due to performance degradation and computation explosion. Besides, the unified embedding for each temporal token fuses multiple variates with potentially unaligned timestamps and distinct physical measurements, which may fail in learning variate-centric representations and result in meaningless attention maps. In this work, we reflect on the competent duties of Transformer components and repurpose the Transformer architecture without any adaptation on the basic components. We propose iTransformer that simply inverts the duties of the attention mechanism and the feed-forward network. Specifically, the time points of individual series are embedded into variate tokens which are utilized by the attention mechanism to capture multivariate correlations; meanwhile, the feed-forward network is applied for each variate token to learn nonlinear representations. The iTransformer model achieves consistent state-of-the-art on several real-world datasets, which further empowers the Transformer family with promoted performance, generalization ability across different variates, and better utilization of arbitrary lookback windows, making it a nice alternative as the fundamental backbone of time series forecasting.},

Specifically, we introduce the pyramidal attention module (PAM) in which the inter-scale tree structure summarizes features at different resolutions and the intra-scale neighboring connections model the temporal dependencies of different ranges. Under mild conditions, the maximum length of the signal traversing path in Pyraformer is a constant (i.e., O(1)) with regard to the sequence length L, while its time and space complexity scale linearly with L. Extensive experimental results show that Pyraformer typically achieves the highest prediction accuracy in both single-step and long-range multi-step forecasting tasks with the least amount of time and memory consumption, especially when the sequence is long1.},

However, they neglected the temporal covariate shift problem, which leads to the learned thresholds cannot be generalized in the test set, resulting in suboptimal detection performance in practical cases. We propose the Adaptive Multivariate Time-series Anomaly Detection framework in this paper, namely DATECT, to address the above challenging problems. Specifically, to enhance the robustness of anomaly measurement, DATECT adopts the dilated convolution based AutoEncoder to integrate both prediction errors and reconstruction errors into the output anomaly scores. Meanwhile, a novel Adaptive Window Normalization method is put forth to reduce the diversity of the distribution of anomaly scores in the test set, hence effectively improving the generalization capability of the detection model. Finally, to further reduce the side-effect of domain-specific dynamic noise, DATECT utilizes Non-parametric Scan Statistics to select the subsets of significantly abnormal signals and highlight the anomaly segments. Experiments on five datasets show that our method can significantly alleviate the performance drop caused by the temporal covariate shift problem, outperforms the baseline in terms of detection performance and generalization, averagely improving the F1-score by 8.66\% and the F1{${_\ast}$}-score (upper bound) by 1.18\%.},

The results suggest that systematic shortrun price insulation reduces shocks to domestic prices but roughly doubles the amplitude of shocks to world prices. Random policy shocks from current policies increase domestic price volatility relative to the magnified volatility of world prices.

In particular, Ising-Traffic formulates traffic prediction under uncertainty into two Ising models: Reconstruct-Ising and Predict-Ising. Reconstruct-Ising is mapped onto modern Ising machines and handles uncertainty in traffic accurately with negligible latency and energy consumption, while Predict-Ising is mapped onto traditional processors and predicts future congestion precisely with only at most 1.8\% computational demands of existing solutions.

The spatial distribution for {$<$}em{$>$}CCD{$<$}/em{$>$} is featured with a stepwise decline among these 11 districts from lower to upper reaches of the Yangtze River, mostly attributed to the lagged industrial and economic growth in the districts of upper and middle reaches.

  abstract = {Accurate forecasting of wind power is of significance for scheduling the grid system when wind power is inte\- grated. However, the deficiency of the training data restricts the models' forecasting performance and modeling efficiency. In this study, we propose a hybrid forecasting model that is composed of a dual dilated convolutionbased self-attention sub-model and an autoregressive sub-model. The dual-branch sub-model utilizes a dual convolution architecture to extract both global and local temporal patterns before capturing attention-based dependencies between multivariate inputs to reflect non-linear correlations. The autoregressive sub-model learns linear correlations to provide supplementary information that compensates for the insensitivity of model response. Furthermore, a multi-task learning-based framework is designed to address insufficient training data of a new turbine cluster. The framework can be divided into one task-shared linear component and multiple task-specific non-linear components. By weighting multiple forecasting tasks, the proposed framework utilizes the collaborative relationships between tasks to improve accuracy on the target turbines. Experiment results show that the proposed forecasting model presents the better forecasting accuracy on actual datasets, and the framework has a significant improvement of 20.08\% in accuracy while further reducing dependence on training data, especially for source domain data in transfer learning.},

  abstract = {Time series (TS) and multiple time series (MTS) predictions have historically paved the way for distinct families of deep learning models. The temporal dimension, distinguished by its evolutionary sequential aspect, is usually modeled by decomposition into the trio of ``trend, seasonality, noise'', by attempts to copy the functioning of human synapses, and more recently, by transformer models with self-attention on the temporal dimension. These models may find applications in finance and e-commerce, where any increase in performance of less than 1\% has large monetary repercussions, they also have potential applications in natural language processing (NLP), medicine, and physics. To the best of our knowledge, the information bottleneck (IB) framework has not received significant attention in the context of TS or MTS analyses. One can demonstrate that a compression of the temporal dimension is key in the context of MTS. We propose a new approach with partial convolution, where a time sequence is encoded into a two-dimensional representation resembling images. Accordingly, we use the recent advances made in image extension to predict an unseen part of an image from a given one. We show that our model compares well with traditional TS models, has information{\textendash}theoretical foundations, and can be easily extended to more dimensions than only time and space. An evaluation of our multiple time series{\textendash}information bottleneck (MTS-IB) model proves its efficiency in electricity production, road traffic, and astronomical data representing solar activity, as recorded by NASA's interface region imaging spectrograph (IRIS) satellite.},

  abstract = {Accurate carbon price forecasting can provide policymakers with a reasonable basis for carbon pricing. Intervalvalued carbon price forecasting could provide sufficient information compared with real-valued carbon price time series prediction. On the other hand, current interval-valued carbon price forecasting has major challenges including data complexity, outliers, and the selection of forecasting methods, which make the forecasting results with great uncertainty and instability. To address these issues, this paper proposes an interval-valued carbon price forecasting method based on new data processing techniques, and discusses the effects of different com\- binations of interval variables on the forecasting results. We first established interval complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) and interval outlier detection method (Iksigma) to reduce the data complexity and identify outliers. Then, various neural network models include in\- terval multilayer perceptron (IMLP), multi-output support vector regression (MSVR), long short-term memory network (LSTM), gated recurrent unit neural network (GRU), and convolution neural network (CNN) are chosen to conduct combination forecasting on the interval sub-modes produced by ICEEMDAN. The final results are obtained by summing the interval sub-modes. Finally, taking the carbon trading price in Hubei as the research object, the results show that the developed forecasting framework is superior to all comparison models in forecasting precision and stability. Furthermore, different combinations of interval variables (CRM, Minmax, L + 2R, and U-2R) lead to different decomposition results and outlier detection results, which finally affect the prediction results.},

  abstract = {Recently, Transformer-based methods have achieved surprising performance in the field of long-term series forecasting, but the attention mechanism for computing global correlations entails high complexity. And they do not allow for targeted modeling of local features as CNN structures do. To solve the above problems, we propose to combine local features and global correlations to capture the overall view of time series (e.g., fluctuations, trends). To fully exploit the underlying information in the time series, a multi-scale branch structure is adopted to model different potential patterns separately. Each pattern is extracted with down-sampled convolution and isometric convolution for local features and global correlations, respectively. In addition to being more effective, our proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, MICN yields 17.2\% and 21.6\% relative improvements for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively.

However, the existing methods of carbon price forecasting mostly regard carbon price series as a certain time series, but pay less attention to the uncertainty implied by carbon price series. Based on this, this paper proposes a forecasting model framework considering the uncertainty of carbon price series, which represents the carbon price series as a time series of probability density function to deal with the uncertainty. A prediction model based on the probability density recurrence network of carbon price is constructed with the help of the recurrence network construction tech\- nology of data and link prediction, and the advantages of the model are verified by numerical simulation. The empirical analysis is made by using the EU carbon price data. In the whole sample interval, we build 123 time windows. The results indicate that our prediction model has better level forecasting precision in 90.69\% time windows and directional prediction accuracy in 67.82\% time windows than the prediction model built based on deterministic network, which can improve the level prediction accuracy and directional prediction accuracy by 25.76\% and 5.09\% on average. By comparing with the accuracy results of existing carbon price prediction models, we discuss the feasibility of improving the prediction effect by increasing the number of similar nodes.},

However, surrogate data typically deviate from test OOD data. Thus, the performance of OE, when facing unseen OOD data, can be weakened. To address this issue, we propose a novel OE-based approach that makes the model perform well for unseen OOD situations, even for unseen OOD cases. It leads to a min-max learning scheme -- searching to synthesize OOD data that leads to worst judgments and learning from such OOD data for uniform performance in OOD detection. In our realization, these worst OOD data are synthesized by transforming original surrogate ones. Specifically, the associated transform functions are learned implicitly based on our novel insight that model perturbation leads to data transformation. Our methodology offers an efficient way of synthesizing OOD data, which can further benefit the detection model, besides the surrogate OOD data. We conduct extensive experiments under various OOD detection setups, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method against its advanced counterparts.},

  abstract = {Counterfactual Regret Minimization algorithms are the most popular way of estimating the Nash Equilibrium in imperfectinformation zero-sum games. In particular, DeepStack - the state-of-the-art Poker bot {\textendash} employs the so-called Deep Counterfactual Value Network (DCVN) to learn the Counterfactual Values (CFVs) associated with various states in the game. Each CFV is a multiplication of two factors: (1) the probability that the opponent would reach a given state in a game, which can be explicitly calculated from the input data, and (2) the expected value (EV) of a payoff in that state, which is a complex function of the input data, hard to calculate. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful modification to the CFVs estimation process, which consists in utilizing a deep neural network to estimate only the EV factor of CFV. This new target setting significantly simplifies the learning problem and leads to much more accurate CFVs estimation. A direct comparison, in terms of CFVs prediction losses, shows a significant prediction accuracy improvement of the proposed approach (DEVN) over the original DCVN formulation (relatively by 9.18 - 15.70\% when using card abstraction, and by 3.37 - 8.39\% without card abstraction, depending on a particular setting). Furthermore, the application of DEVN improves the theoretical lower bound of the error by 29.05 - 31.83\% compared to the DCVN pipeline when card abstraction is applied.},

In this work, we design a special Transformer, i.e., channel-aligned robust dual Transformer (CARD for short), that addresses key shortcomings of Transformer in time series forecasting. First, CARD introduces a dual Transformer structure that allows it to capture both temporal correlations among signals and dynamical dependence among multiple variables over time. Second, we introduce a robust loss function for time series forecasting to alleviate the potential overfitting issue. This new loss function weights the importance of forecasting over a finite horizon based on prediction uncertainties.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Rapid growth in solar power generation, accompanied by random fluctuations, has important implications for the security, stability, and productivity of the grid. Therefore, accurate predictions of solar power generation provide an essential benchmark for relevant institutions to conduct grid planning and power dispatch. Thereby, a novel data-driven seasonal multivariable grey model is proposed for simulating seasonal fluctuations and non-linear trends in solar power generation. To be specific, the novel model contains the following refinements: first, the seasonal factors and time-power item are introduced to modify the insensitivity of traditional multivariable grey models to seasonal fluctuations and non-linear trends. Second, to enhance the generalizability and adaptability of the model, the parameter associated with the time-power item is determined by using the genetic algorithm. Third, on the premise of proving the model's requirements for period length and sample size, the derivation of the time response function is expounded.

By implementing statistical filtering to pre-process the data, the optimal reference curved surface is constructed based on the filtered terrain data, the theoretical optimal depth value of each beam point is calculated. The optimal reference curved surface is filtered by combining the depth tolerance to determine whether the point is a noise point. Then the trend surface is constructed using the filtered non-noise data, and the trend surface is filtered on the original point cloud data. Through the verification of the measured data, this method can effectively remove most of the cluster noises in the multi-beam bathymetric data and is more efficient than manual processing.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Since energy consumption (EC) is becoming an important issue for sustainable development in the world, it has a practical significance to predict EC effectively. However, there are two main uncertainty factors affecting the accuracy of a region's EC prediction. Firstly, with the ongoing rapid changes in society, the consumption amounts can be non-smooth or even fluctuating during a long time period, which makes it difficult to investigate the sequence's trend in order to forecast. Secondly, in a given region, it is difficult to express the consumption amount as a real number, as there are different development levels in the region, which would be more suitably described as interval numbers. Most traditional prediction models for energy consumption forecasting deal with long-term real numbers. It is seldom found to discover research that focuses specifically on uncertain EC data. To this end, a novel energy consumption forecasting model has been established by expressing ECs in a region as interval grey numbers combining with the optimized discrete grey model (DGM(1,1)) in Grey System Theory (GST). To prove the effectiveness of the method, per capita annual electricity consumption in southern Jiangsu of China is selected as an example. The results show that the proposed model reveals the best accuracy for the short data sequences (the average fitting error is only 2.19\% and the average three-step forecasting error is less than 4\%) compared with three GM models and four classical statistical models. By extension, any fields of EC, such as petroleum consumption, natural gas consumption, can also be predicted using this novel model. As the sustained growth in EC of China's, it is of great significance to predict EC accurately to manage serious energy security and environmental pollution problems, as well as formulating relevant energy policies by the government.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Traditional FTSF is regarded as an expert system which leads to lose the ability to recognize undefined feature. The mentioned is main reason of poor forecasting with FTSF. To solve the problem, the proposed model Differential Fuzzy Convolutional Neural Network (DFCNN) utilizes convolution neural network to re-implement FTSF with learnable ability. DFCNN is capable of recognizing the potential information and improve the forecasting accuracy. Thanks to learnable ability of neural network, length of fuzzy rules established in FTSF is expended to arbitrary length which expert is not able to be handle by expert system. At the same time, FTSF usually cannot achieve satisfactory performance of non-stationary time series due to trend of non-stationary time series. The trend of non-stationary time series causes the fuzzy set established by FTSF to invalid and cause the forecasting to fail. DFCNN utilizes the Difference algorithm to weaken the non-stationarity of time series, so that DFCNN can forecast the non-stationary time series with low error that FTSF cannot forecast in satisfactory performance. After mass of experiments, DFCNN has excellent prediction effect, which is ahead of the existing FTSF and common time series forecasting algorithms. Finally, DFCNN provides further ideas for improving FTSF and holds continued research value.},

In particular, Transformer-based models have shown great potential because they can capture long-term dependency. However, existing Transformerbased models mainly focus on modeling the temporal dependency (cross-time dependency) yet often omit the dependency among different variables (crossdimension dependency), which is critical for MTS forecasting. To fill the gap, we propose Crossformer, a Transformer-based model utilizing cross-dimension dependency for MTS forecasting. In Crossformer, the input MTS is embedded into a 2D vector array through the Dimension-Segment-Wise (DSW) embedding to preserve time and dimension information. Then the Two-Stage Attention (TSA) layer is proposed to efficiently capture the cross-time and cross-dimension dependency. Utilizing DSW embedding and TSA layer, Crossformer establishes a Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder (HED) to use the information at different scales for the final forecasting. Extensive experimental results on six real-world datasets show the effectiveness of Crossformer against previous state-of-the-arts.},

Digital product imports improve the quality of export products through three mechanisms: technology spillovers, productivity, and information-searching capabilities. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that digital product imports have greater impacts on foreign-owned and capital-intensive firms, and digital intermediate imports play a bigger role than do digital non-intermediate imports.

However, traditional grey models pay more attention to temporal information, meanwhile disregarding the presence of spatial features critical to producing accurate forecasts. Moreover, the grey theory has few attempts to overcome this problem. Given this situation, this paper proposes a novel multivariable grey prediction model considering the spatial proximity effect for time series forecasting. More specifically, the complete spatial distance index is defined initially based on the geographical and economic distance to quantify the intensity of the spatial proximity impact. On this basis, the spatial proximity effect term is constructed and incorporated into the conventional discrete multivariable grey model, establishing the novel model. Subsequently, the particle swarm optimization algorithm determines the optimal weight coefficient in the developed index. For illustration and verification purposes, the proposed model performs experiments predicting Jiangsu's economic outputs compared to five prevalent benchmarks. Furthermore, three statistical metrics, the Diebold-Mariano test, the Monte Carlo experiments, and the probability density analysis are employed to validate the model's efficacy and robustness. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all five competitors with strong robustness and broad generalization. Therefore, this new model is used for forecasting Jiangsu's future economic outputs from 2021 to 2025.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

To address these problems, we propose to combine Transformer with the seasonal-trend decomposition method, in which the decomposition method captures the global profile of time series while Transformers capture more detailed structures. To further enhance the performance of Transformer for long-term prediction, we exploit the fact that most time series tend to have a sparse representation in well-known basis such as Fourier transform, and develop a frequency enhanced Transformer. Besides being more effective, the proposed method, termed as Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Transformer (FEDformer), is more efficient than standard Transformer with a linear complexity to the sequence length.

Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a ProbSparse self-attention mechanism, which achieves O(L log L) in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the LSTF problem.},
